# Data Forge - Modern Architecture for Future Growth

## 1. Executive Summary & Goals
- **Primary Objective:** Modular Application to achieve **State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance** for critical data operations while maintaining a modern, robust, and simple design that supports future feature expansion and rapid development, capable to handle 1 bilion rows of data.

- **Key Goals:**
    1. **Optimize SOTA Performance:** Performance for critical operations like bulk reads and writes by minimizing abstraction layers and maximizing direct data paths, leveraging Parquet, Polars, PyArrow, Pydantic or DuckDB.
    2. **Pragmatic Modularity:** Establish a clear middle ground between over-abstraction and pragmatic design to enhance maintainability, extensibility, and the efficient integration of new, diverse features.
    3. **Schema-Driven Flexibility:** Retain the powerful schema-driven design to allow unparalleled user flexibility in database management and dynamic data handling.

## 2. Key Considerations & Risk Mitigation

- **Performance vs. Modularity:** Strictly minimize abstraction in performance-critical paths, but maintain modularity for extensibility.
- **Complexity in New Features:** Isolate feature-specific logic to prevent core performance degradation.
- **Dependencies:** Focus on a stable, high-performance core before expanding integrations.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** SOTA performance, scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and usability are all addressed by the modular, schema-driven design.

## 3. Assumptions
- The application is local-first, prioritizing performance for core operations (e.g., using Parquet, DuckDB).
- Future features will be developed incrementally.
- Schema flexibility and interactive data exploration are highly valued by users.
